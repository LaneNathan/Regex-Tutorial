### Look-ahead and Look-behind

Look-ahead and Look-behind are terms to reference advanced features in regex that match patterns only if it is or isn't followed or preceded by another without actually matches the characters in the string. These include `(?=...)` to match the preceding pattern only if it is followed by the pattern inside the parentheses and `(?!...)` to match the preceding pattern only if it is not followed by the pattern inside the parentheses. These are refered to as look-ahead assertations while, `(?<=...)` and `(?<!...)` are look-behind. `(?<=...)` matches the following pattern only if it is preceded by the pattern inside the parentheses and `(?<!...)` matches the following pattern only if it is not preceded by the pattern inside the parentheses.
